# Accounting System for the Average Joe

It can be difficult for individuals to manage and keep track of their incomes, expenditures, amount of money they currently have in cash or in different accounts, etc. It is even more difficult for them to capture trends in their income and expenses as past records may be lost and it is very time-consuming to compare present with past.

To make the life of an individual just a bit easier, we plan to create a simple accounting system that will be easy to use. With such digital tools at their disposal, records will be easy to look up, change and analyze without spending time going through tedious calculations or looking for past records.

## Software to be used:
- Will be created in Ubuntu environment
- Will be compiled with Makefile
- Will comprise of programs made with C++11 standard

## Features to be included:
- Records will contain information in columns:
  1. the first column will contain the date (date may or may not be divided into three columns showing day, month and year)
  2. the second column will have two options only, "income" or "expense" showing whether the amount should be added or subtracted
  3. the account to be added to or subtracted from (cash, bank account etc)
  4. the type of income or expenditure (income from part-time job, food expenses etc) 
  5. the amount of money
- Users can add, edit or delete records at any time
- Records can be viewed at any time by date, account and type of income or expenditure
- Features a budget setting in which an alert will be issued if expenses reach the budget
- Statistical reports such as monthly income and expenses (with percentages spent on each *type* of expense) will be available, average monthly income and expenses will also be calculated
- Comparisons betweeen a specific month and average monthly income or expenses can be displayed (for example difference between average monthly food costs and food cost of a specific month chosen by user)

## Directions:
A brief tutorial on how to use the program will be uploaded (complete with screenshots) once program is complete!
